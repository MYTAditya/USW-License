### [Version 1](https://github.com/MYTAditya/USW-License/blob/master/COPYING.USWLv1)

The first version of Universal Sonic Worlds License. For this case, you have to add the engine's intro animation on your game and also have to add a notice about the license and copyright. This licence was replaced by version 2 of it. This licence provides permissions for commercial use, distribution, modification and private use and contains limitations for liability and warranty.
